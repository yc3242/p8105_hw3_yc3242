I used the tidyverse library through the whole problem set.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Problem 1

First, I loaded the dataset for problem 3 from the following library.

```{r brfss_import}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Next, I cleaned the data and focused on the `Overall Health` topic and organized responses as factor taking levels ordered from "Excellent" to "Poor".

```{r}
brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%                          # clean variable names
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>%      # redefine columns
  janitor::clean_names() %>%                          # clean variable names for new columns
  select(year:excellent, very_good, good, fair, poor)
```
